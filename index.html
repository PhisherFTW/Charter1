                    <p> Join us for a deep-sea fishing charter leaving Port Canaveral, near Cocoa Beach and Cape Canaveral, and experience hard pulling fish such as Grouper, Snapper, Sharks, and Amberjack. Try to tame the fast and furious Wahoo, Kingfish, and Barracuda. Enjoy the excitement of high jumping Sailfish, Tarpon, and Mahi. Bask in the thrill of site fishing for Cobia or Tripletail. Travel to the Gulf Stream’s backside in search of Yellowfin Tuna, Blue Marlin, and White Marlin. Explore the Continental Shelf’s depths by deep dropping for Swordfish, Tilefish, Snowy Grouper, and Yellow Edge Grouper.

                    Customers often ask us when the best time of year is to catch certain fish. We keep daily catch records every day that we fish. You can see past catches on our statistics page. We also have a fishing month-by-month infographic page that you can see what fish we are most likely to catch each month of the year.</p>

They also know all of the latest regulations – both state and federal.  Our captains are all certified by the US Coast Guard to operate fishing charters in the State of Florida.

                        Fishing is in our blood, and we can’t imagine doing anything else. We also talk to each other about the bite throughout the day and after each trip so that we can make sure you get the best experience possible!</p>
